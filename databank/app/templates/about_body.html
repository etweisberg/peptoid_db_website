<h1>The Peptoid Data Bank</h1>
<p>
  The PeptoidDB serves to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive
  source of all known, experimentally determined, high-resolution,
  three-dimensional peptoid structures. While currently the number of X-ray
  crystal and NMR structures is limited, it is our hope that this database will
  provide researchers with convenient structural information that will allow the
  database to expand, providing more insight into peptoid conformation.
</p>
<h1>New Features</h1>
<p>
  The <em>new</em> Peptoid Data Bank allows researchers to search for peptoids
  published by specific authors, containing specific residues, with a certain
  DOI, topology, or ones solved by one of the two experimental techniques.
  Additionally, the new Peptoid Data Bank offers an API (Application Programming
  Interface) that can be used by researchers to access data from the database
  with their own custom code.

<h1>About the Data</h1>
<p>
  Published structures consisting of at least three tertiary amide bonds, linked
  only by methylene units, are included here. Structures consisting only of
  Proline are omitted, as they are well-respresented in other data banks.
  Listings for X-ray crystal structures link to the data deposited in the
  <a href="https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-core/components/CSD/"
    >Cambridge Structural Database</a
  >. Listings for NMR structures link to the original publication, where each
  structure is available as Supporting Information.
