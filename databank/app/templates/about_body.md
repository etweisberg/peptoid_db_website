# The Peptoid Data Bank
The PeptoidDB serves to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive source of all known, experimentally determined, high-resolution, three-dimensional peptoid structures. While currently the number of X-ray crystal and NMR structures is limited, it is our hope that this database will provide researchers with convenient structural information that will allow the database to expand, providing more insight into peptoid conformation.

# New Features
The *new* Peptoid Data Bank allows researchers to search for peptoids published by specific authors, containing specific residues, with a certain DOI, topology, or ones solved by one of the two experimental techniques. Additionally, the new Peptoid Data Bank offers an API (Application Programming Interface) that can be used by researchers to access data from the database with their own custom code. 

# About the Data
Published structures consisting of at least three tertiary amide bonds, linked only by methylene units, are included here. Structures consisting only of Proline are omitted, as they are well-respresented in other data banks. Listings for X-ray crystal structures link to the data deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-core/components/CSD/). Listings for NMR structures link to the original publication, where each structure is available as Supporting Information.
